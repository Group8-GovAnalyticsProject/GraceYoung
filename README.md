I originally was just working with the COVID data, but there wasn't much cleaning involved so I decided to bring another data set as well (median income from 2019 ACS data).

I have included the raw data for both data sets as well as the cleaned files. Cleaning takes place in project_cleaning.ipynb. The COVID cases I split into two sets - the total number of cases up to the point of park count observation, and total number of cases through January 2021. I did this because I wouldn't expect cases occurring after the park collection date to impact the number of people going to parks from that tract.
